#  Contributor's Guide

These are some general guidelines for contributing to this project.

## Software Inclusion Criteria

Due to the sheer amount of software avilable, we have to limit the list to a smaller quantity.
This is our guideline on what might be worth including:

The software...

- ...should help the user actively avoid generative AI in their everday life.

- ...has to have no AI features, or less than the available popular competition (e.g. LibreWolf vs. Firefox)

  - If there are AI features, they should be opt-in only, and they should run privately and locally only,
    e.g. like LibreWolf's page translation, and they shouldn't encourage the user to commit potential
    plagiarism.

- ...should come with a clear statement, blog post, code of conduct or similar to declare an intended
  avoidance of AI use and features, or similar.

## No AI

Obviously, don't contribute anything using generative AI. We don't want any AI slop, thank you.

## Catagory Inclusion Criteria
### Software
Due to the sheer amount of software avilable, we have to limit the list to a smaller quantity. 
The following criterias have to be met for a software to be included. Software...
- ...must help the user activly avoid AI in their everday life.
- ...has to have no / a **LOW QUANTITY** of AI features
  - if there are AI features, they have to be **OPT-IN** not **OPT-OUT**
- ...a clear statement, blockpost, code of conduct or any other document that provides enough information to assume
  that there won't be any AI introduction in the near future.

# Why AI contributions are not allowed

For legal reasons, **we absolutely cannot accept any contributions
made by generative AI** since it might put `<project name>`'s ecosystem
into uncertainty and it seems unethical. (This isn't legal advice
or a request for legal advice.)

To reduce risks, `<project name>`'s DCO requires you to state if
you made the contribution and can guarantee it's not plagiarized
whenever you contribute. But with the legal situation around AI,
many industry analysists seem to suspect this isn't compatible with
AI output, even if just auto-complete snippets. [See this article
for a more in-depth
explanation, including other reasons like quality
control](https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/16/gentoo_linux_ai_ban/).

In addition, the productivity boost of gen AI for devs appears
questionable in [various studies](

), and the ecological effects seem dire.

Until this situation is more cleared up, we therefore don't want
any gen AI contributions of any kind, including no AI auto completions.

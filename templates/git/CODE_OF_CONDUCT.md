# Code of Conduct
## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standarts
As a community we have certain standarts that shall not be ignored or removed. They are the base of the project and stand above all other rules.

### AI Usage
AI has been applied to a lot of different fields over the years, being used more and more as time goes on. 
Even though it "could" be used as a tool, many choose not to and try to employ it as a replacement for their own brains.
Therefore all usage of AI is forbidden, because it is not only ethically and morally wrong, but also produces issues, bugs and other problems in a bigger scope than any human ever could.

This is a small list of examples where AI usage is forbidden. Do note that any usage of AI will not be tolerated, this is just a guideline to present the scope of this ban:
- Writing any comments, issues, pull requests or other form of text
- Using generated code that you willingly produced (if you used already existing code from an otherwise credible source that was created by AI and didn't notice it, this does not apply)
- Solving issues, problems, etc.
- Restructuring code
- Using any features of a platform for this project, that generate any form of content using AI
- [...]

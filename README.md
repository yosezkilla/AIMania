# AIMania
**This repository is a collection of resources that might help with avoiding gen AI.**
It was written by coders for coders, as an attempt to help others as an unpaid volunteer effort.
You'll likely find mistakes, please [fix them](https://github.com/Vxrpenter/AIMania/pulls).

The primary purpose is to provide information, fast and reliably. We link to other projects and
try to always provide the data sources. Even though this repository is primarily meant for developers,
it may still provide useful information for "casual" people.

## Avoid AI Citations

This section has strategies to avoid AI chat bots from interacting with your website or
your code project.

  This token apparently stops Claude Code from interacting with your code project if put
  into a `CLAUDE.md` file in your code tree.
  It may also stop it from interacting with your website if put into the web page code,
  e.g. as a HTML comment. (Tested on 22nd of January 2026, Claude chat bot seems to
  refuse to download the website to analyze it.)

## Avoid AI Crawling

Currently hard to do, but here are some known options:

- [Anubis](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis). Sadly, using this will likely unlist
  all protected pages from web searches, too. But the landing page could be
  excluded, for example.
- Blocking crawlers using [robots.txt](https://github.com/Vxrpenter/AIMania/blob/main/templates/robots.txt). It's important
  to understand that AI companies are not forced to follow this file, they might, but could also ignore it. Most big companies will respect
  it but you never know.
- Try to avoid code hosters that run on one of the big cloud providers that are known
  for gathering data for AI training, or that integrate gen AI directly into the UI.
  As of today, [Codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org) appears to be fairly safe, while
  [Github.com integrates Co-Pilot AI deeply](https://github.com).

## UBlock Filters
These are some filters for blocking AI buttons / content. When using some of these filters
you may experience a degraded experience because certain other buttons might not show up. The 
easiest solution most of the times is reloading the page:
- [GitHub Copilot Filters](https://codeberg.org/rossabaker/github-copilot-filters/src/branch/main/filters.txt)
- [Huge AI Blocklist](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist)

## Clear AI Guidelines

Although it's unlikely that the AI enthusiast are going to follow a guideline / coc,
it's still a viable option to drive away the few people who respect rules set up
by a maintainer. Please note these are just examples, use any at your own risk.

We have some examples for how such a Code Of Conduct might look like:
- [Basic Anti AI COC](https://github.com/Vxrpenter/AIMania/blob/main/examples/git/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

There are also snippets that might inspire an anti AI `README.md` note:
- [No AI due to legal reasons](https://github.com/Vxrpenter/AIMania/blob/main/examples/readme/ai-legal.md)

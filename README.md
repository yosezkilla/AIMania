# AIMania
**This repository is a collection of resources that might help with avoiding gen AI.**
It was written by coders for coders, as an attempt to help others as an unpaid volunteer effort.
You'll likely find mistakes, please [fix them](https://github.com/Vxrpenter/AIMania/pulls).

The primary purpose is to provide information, fast and reliably. We link to other projects and
try to always provide the data sources. Even though this repository is primarily meant for developers,
it may still provide useful information for "casual" people.

## Software

This is an incomplete list of software to use when trying to avoid AI.
### Operating System
The practical choices with good driver support tend to be Windows, the Apple
ecosystem, or Linux.
If you want to avoid gen AI, [avoid Windows](
https://pureinfotech.com/microsoft-defends-ai-criticism-windows-11/).
Apple with their macOS seem to also be [quite pro-AI](
https://www.digitaltrends.com/phones/apple-plans-to-turn-siri-into-a-full-ai-chatbot-to-take-on-chatgpt-and-gemini/)
and [seem to be restrictive and anti free open software too](
https://eclecticlight.co/2020/08/22/apple-silicon-macs-will-require-signed-code/).

In general, Linux is your best choice for avoiding AI and to have user freedom.
*(Note: We don't recommend ChromeOS [as it seems to be folding into Android](
https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-os-becoming-android-3500661/) and
Android [seems anti user freedom too](https://troypoint.com/google-confirms-android-sideloading-restrictions-for-2026/)).*

We don't want to recommend specific Linux variants here, but the following links may help you:

- [Guide for picking a Linux variant.](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major)

### Browsers
- [Librewolf](https://librewolf.net/)
- [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) - *depends on this [statement](https://vivaldi.com/blog/technology/vivaldi-wont-allow-a-machine-to-lie-to-you/)*

## Avoid AI Citations

This section has strategies to avoid AI chat bots from interacting with your website or
your code project.

- Adding a [CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/Vxrpenter/AIMania/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) with the
  token to stop Claude access.
  This token apparently stops Claude Code from interacting with your code project if put
  into a `CLAUDE.md` file in your code tree.
  It may also stop it from interacting with your website if you put the token into the web page code,
  e.g. as a HTML comment. (Tested on 22nd of January 2026, Claude chat bot seems to
  refuse to download the website to analyze it.)
- Adding a [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/Vxrpenter/AIMania/blob/main/AGENTS.md).
  This could stop AI agents from interacting with the repository, by giving it names it
  can legally not respond to.
- Adding a [copilot-instructions.md](https://github.com/Vxrpenter/AIMania/blob/main/copilot-instructions.md).
  This gives copilot instructions for interacting with the repository. This could force it to
  stop interactions with it completely.
- For websites only: `<meta name="robots" content="nosnippet" />`

## Avoid AI Crawling

Currently hard to do, but here are some known options:

- [Anubis](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis). Sadly, using this will likely unlist
  all protected pages from web searches, too. But the landing page could be
  excluded, for example.
  - Anubis can be configured to [allow well-behaved bots and legitimate automation scenarios](https://anubis.techaro.lol/docs/admin/policies/) if you so desire
- [Iocaine](https://iocaine.madhouse-project.org/). A lightweight garbage generator that aims to keep AI crawlers away from heavy operations, and instead traps them in a maze made to poison the dataset.
  - The default handler does a lot, but the author also provides their own handler in the form of [Nam-Shub of Enki](https://3.nam-shub-of-enki.iocaine.madhouse-project.org/index.html).
- Blocking crawlers using [robots.txt](https://github.com/Vxrpenter/AIMania/blob/main/templates/robots.txt). It's important
  to understand that AI companies are not forced to follow this file, they might, but could also ignore it. Most big companies will respect
  it but you never know.
- Try to avoid code hosters that run on one of the big cloud providers that are known
  for gathering data for AI training, or that integrate gen AI directly into the UI.
  As of today, [Codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org) appears to be fairly safe, while
  [Github.com appears to integrate Co-Pilot AI deeply](
  https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/05/github_copilot_complaints/).

## UBlock Filters
These are some filters for blocking AI buttons / content. When using some of these filters
you may experience a degraded experience because certain other buttons might not show up. The 
easiest solution most of the times is reloading the page:
- [GitHub Copilot Filters](https://codeberg.org/rossabaker/github-copilot-filters/src/branch/main/filters.txt)
- [Huge AI Blocklist](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist)

## Clear AI Guidelines

Although it's unlikely that the AI enthusiast are going to follow a guideline / coc,
it's still a viable option to drive away the few people who respect rules set up
by a maintainer. Please note these are just examples, use any at your own risk.

We have some examples for how such a Code Of Conduct might look like:
- [Basic Anti AI COC](https://github.com/Vxrpenter/AIMania/blob/main/examples/git/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

There are also snippets that might inspire an anti AI `README.md` note:
- [No AI due to legal reasons](https://github.com/Vxrpenter/AIMania/blob/main/examples/readme/ai-legal.md)
